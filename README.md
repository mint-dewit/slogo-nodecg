# Slogo NodeCG bundle

Based on the excellent template by [zoton2](https://github.com/zoton2/nodecg-vue-ts-template). Many thanks.

## Templates

- [x] Lower thirds
- [x] Strap (location / time)
- [x] Logo overlays
- [x] Countdown

## Configurability

Logos, images and colours should all be configurable such that the templates can be used throughout the programming but a consistent style can be kept.
